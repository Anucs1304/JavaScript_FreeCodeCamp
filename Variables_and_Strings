What is JavaScript, and how does it work with HTML and CSS?
 - HTML provides structure, CSS adds styling, and JavaScript enables functional behavior, creating a complete and interactive web experience.
 - JavaScript interacts with the page to change content and styles dynamically.

What is a Data Type and what are the different data types
 - Data types help the program understand the kind of data it's working with, whether it's a number, text, of something else.
 - Number, string, boolean, undefined, null, object, symbols and BigInt.

What are the variables, and what are the rules for naming JavaScript variables?
 - Variables act as containers for storing data that you can access and modify throughout your program.
 - Variable names should describe what the data represents. Must begin with a letter, an underscore, or a dollar sign. They cannot start with a number.
 - Variable names are case-sensitive and cannot use reserved keywords.

How do let and const works?
 - let keyword allows you to declare variables that can be updated or reassigned later. It's a flexible container.
 - Const is used to declare variables that are constant. Variable declared with const cannot be reassigned.

String concatenation
 - We can combine strings using +, +=, concat() method.

Role of semicolons
 - A semicolon is used to indicate the end of a statement or instructions, helping the compiler or interpreter parse the code correctly.
 - Improve code readability and help avoid errors related to Automatic Semicolon Insertion.

Comments
 - Comments are used to provide additional context for the code or leave notes for yourself and others.
 - Comments are lines or blocks of text that are ignored by the JavaScript engine when code is executed.
 - Other developers working on the projext will understand the purpose of this code.
 - It helps prevent unnecessary changes or deletions without consulting the team, which could lead to bugs or issues.

Dynamic vs Statical Typing
 - JavaScript's dynamic typing allows variables to change types freely which offers flexibility but can lead to unexpexted errors during exectution.
 - Statically typed languages like Java require you to specify variable types upfront, which helps catch errors before the program runs but offers less flexibility.

Type of Operator Work and type of null bug
 - Values like null were represented as a special type of object, leading to this unexpected result.

Bracket Notation and access characters from a string
 - To access specific characters in a string, such as extracting initials from a name or checking a specific letter for validation. We can access with the help of index.

Newline in strings and escape strings
 - The \n escape sequence tells JavaScript to insert a line break at a point, which results in the string being displayed across multiple lines.
 - The backslash tells JavaScript to treat the quotes as literal characters, so they appear correctlu in the output.
 - Escaping and creating newlines are essential when you’re formatting output or handling special characters in strings. These techniques help you prevent errors and ensure your text appears exactly as intended.

Template Literals and String Interpolation
 - Template literals are particularly useful when you need to include variables or expressions in strings, format complex strings, or work with multiline text. They are more concise and readable compared to traditional string concatenation.

Position of a substring in a string
 - The indexOf() is a case sensitive method allows to search for a substring within a string.
 - Using indexOf() can be very useful when you need to check if a substring is present in a string and to determine its position for further operations.

Prompt () method
 - It opens a dialog box that asks the user for some input, and then it returns the text entered by the user as a string.
 - The prompt() method will halt the execution of the script until the user interacts with the dialog box.
